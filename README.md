# Object_Detection
This repository has the object detection entity.
Object detection is one of the most important applications of computer vision, where the goal is to identify what objects are present in an image and where they are located.
YOLO (You Only Look Once) is a state-of-the-art real-time object detection model known for its speed and accuracy.
In this project, YOLOv8 was implemented in Google Colab to detect vehicles in an image named Car.jpg. The model successfully identified cars and generated a processed output image with bounding boxes.
